# Respawnable Pets

This mod allows your tamed pets to respawn once you next sleep in a bed, with a configurable blacklist via
the `respawnablepets:cannot_respawn` entity_types tag. Respawning is toggled with a new item, the Etheric Gem, which
only works on pets you own.

Toggling respawn status is done via interacting [Use Item/Place Block] with a pet. You can also set multiple pets in a
9x3x9 area to respawn by sneak using with the Etheric Gem.
